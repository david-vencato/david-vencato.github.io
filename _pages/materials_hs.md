## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

- [**Handout: Betti Numbers**](/assets/Betti_handout.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  
  This handout is based on a conference I held together with three colleagues, organized by the *Accademia dei Giovani per la Scienza*     and the University of Pisa. The talk was aimed at high school students, using informal and intuitive language to introduce Betti         numbers and basic topology concepts.

- [**Seconda Prova di Matematica (Maturit√† 24/25)**](/assets/commenti_maturita_25.pdf){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}  
  A file in Italian where I propose the solution of a part of a problem from the 2024/25 Italian scientific high school final exam using inequalities between means instead of the classic differential calculus.
