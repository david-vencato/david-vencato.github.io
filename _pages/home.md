> *Mathematician in training, fascinated by patterns and proofs. I enjoy sharing my research and making math accessible.*

Starting from **August 2025**, I will be a **PhD Research Fellow in Stochastic Analysis and Applications** at the **University of Oslo**, under the supervision of **Professor Giulia Di Nunno**.

This page is intended to:

- keep track of the progress of my research,
- share materials that may be useful at various levels — from high school students to Master’s students,
- and occasionally offer reflections on topics beyond mathematics, such as **sports**, a deep passion of mine.

Whether you're here out of curiosity, academic interest, or by chance, I hope you’ll find something valuable.

Feel free to get in touch, you can contact me at: [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }})
